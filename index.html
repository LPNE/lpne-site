<h2 class="info">A Little Info</h1>
<p class="bio">Damian Redd started LPNE (Looking Pass the Naked Eye) in 2006 as his freelance photography avenue. Having created photographic portfolios for various models, performing family photography, and some events, Damian decided it was time to expand. Teaching himself graphic design in late 2008, he gained more clientele for his expanded services. In 2014, a company in Hong Kong even reached out to LPNE for package design services, and 2016 a Ukrainian Pop singer reached out for graphic design services. Today, Damian Redd utilizes LPNE to network and grow his business of Web & Mobile App Development, Graphic & Web Design, and Commercial Photography to assist in the growth of startup companies and small businesses as well as providing individual services to those who request and require.</p>
